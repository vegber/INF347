# INF347
INF347 - Hardware Security
This course aims to give in the first part of the course an introduction to and an overview over concepts like types of physical attacks, 
countermeasures applied on various levels to protect HW implementations against those attacks.  
In the second part of the course more advanced techniques for protecting HW and SW implementations will be 
introduced and their practical implementation will be demonstrated.

### Overview of hardware security, 
Basics in Cryptography and Boolean functions specifically needed for 
the purpose of the course, 
- HW root of trust
- Side-channel attacks,
- Fault attacks 
- Micro-architectural attacks on MCUs
- Countermeasures against side channel and fault attacks
- Secure hardware masking 
- Tools for verification of security of HW implementations
- practical evaluation of 
- Protected HW implementations
- Standardization and certification of HW implementations
- *Applications and recent developments*

On completion of the course the student should be able to describe how 
typical cyber-physical attacks on HW/SW implementations work and to describe techniques for protecting 
the implementations against these attacks.
